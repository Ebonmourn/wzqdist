# wzqdist

the .xlsx is just the csv with the data in a table format and as an excel document


tdist = total distance traveled between map markers in wow-pro leveling guides

tnum = total number of quest turn-in steps found in the guides

adist = average distance traveled per quest turn-in step

txp = total xp found from the quests (this will be lower for the starter zones and the level cap zones since they don't have a proper max scaled lvl on the wow db site (were i pulled the quest xp data from)

tlvl = this is a pointless column and can mostly be ignored, its the sum of levels found from the quests

axp = this is the average lvl found from the quests, tlvl / qnum

xp/lvl = this is the average xp found per quest, txp / qnum

qnum = this is the total number of quest id's that were used

qdata = this is just a storage of all the quest id's and the lvl and xp amounts a script I made found for the id's
